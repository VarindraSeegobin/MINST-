This is my "Hello, World!" into the world of machine learning.

To run this project, download the zip file and unzip into any directory. Install Python on your machine if not done already (3.9+). 
Once you do that, open the folder in any IDE and follow these steps:

1. On MAC, type these commands into the terminal (if on windows skip to step 2):
  python3 -m pip install virtualenv
  python3 -m virtualenv venv
  source ./venv/bin/activate

2. On Windows, type these commands into the terminal:
   python -m venv venv
   venv/scripts/activate

3. Type 'pip install requirements.txt' into the terminal and wait until completed.
4. Go to 'draw.py' and run this file (should be the play button in the top right of your IDE). You can also right click the file and click run.
5. On the box that pops up, draw any number between 0 and 9 and then click space. The prediction will pop up in the run box at the bottom of your IDE.
